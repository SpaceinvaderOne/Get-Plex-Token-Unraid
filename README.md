## What is a Plex Token?

A Plex token is an authentication credential that allows applications to interact with your Plex Media Server without requiring username/password authentication. It's commonly needed for:

- Third-party applications like JellEmPlex Dedupe
- API integrations
- Monitoring tools
- Custom scripts

## Troubleshooting

### No Running Plex Containers Found

1. Ensure your Plex container is running
2. Check if your container name matches one of the supported patterns
3. Add your container name to the `PLEX_CONTAINERS` array in the script

### Token Extraction Failed

1. Make sure Plex has been set up and claimed to your account
2. Verify the Preferences.xml file exists in your appdata folder
3. Check container mount configurations

### Common Manual Locations

If the script fails, you can manually check these locations:
- `/mnt/user/appdata/plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml`
- `/mnt/user/appdata/binhex-plex/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml`

Look for the `PlexOnlineToken` attribute in the XML file.

## Security Notes

- Keep your Plex token secure and don't share it publicly
- The token provides access to your Plex server
- Consider regenerating the token if you suspect it's been compromised

## Requirements

- Unraid server with Userscripts plugin
- Running Plex container
- Plex server that has been claimed/set up
